# Icons

## Build-in Icons

There are some built-in social icons in the theme, all from [iconcont](https://www.iconcont.cn/):

![icons](../../.vuepress/public/iconfont.png)

Just fill the beginning with 'icon-' into CSS class, eg: `iconfont icon-twitter-fill`.

The icons are mainly used in related pages, of course, you can also use any place by HTML. 

## Custom Icons

If you want to use other icons, you can set `iconfont` of **_static_prefix.yml** to include your own Iconfont or Font-Awesome, and then insert them to css class.
